**Philosophers**


The Philosophers project is about simulating a classic problem in concurrency: the Dining Philosophers problem. The goal was to create a program where multiple philosophers sit at a table, thinking and eating, while sharing forks. The challenge was to avoid deadlock and ensure that each philosopher can eat without blocking others.

In this project, I implemented the solution using threads and mutexes to manage synchronization between the philosophers. The key was to ensure that the philosophers could access the shared resources (forks) in a way that prevented conflicts, such as deadlock or resource starvation.

Through Philosophers, I gained experience with multi-threading and synchronization techniques, which are crucial for building efficient, concurrent applications.
